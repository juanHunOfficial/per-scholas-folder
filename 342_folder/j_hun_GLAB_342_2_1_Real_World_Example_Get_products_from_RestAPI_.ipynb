        "\n",
        "- **Searching for Products:** You will learn how to search for products using the API's search functionality. By modifying the API endpoint URL to include a search query (e.g., https://dummyjson.com/products/search?q=Oil), you can retrieve products related to a specific keyword. The results will be displayed in the Colab output."
