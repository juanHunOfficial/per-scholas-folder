    "***NOTE:*** within the package, there are multiple functions that can be called. Usually Python tries to keep naming conventions simple for the programmers with function names like the `sample()` function. The `random.sample()` function \"chooses a sample/multiple items from a Python list, set, or dictionary. It returns a list of unique items chosen randomly from the list, sequence, or set.\" This will come in handy later when we start manipulating data since it is a pre-built tool that can pull samples based on the input we give it and it will return to us a random sample segment from our data."
