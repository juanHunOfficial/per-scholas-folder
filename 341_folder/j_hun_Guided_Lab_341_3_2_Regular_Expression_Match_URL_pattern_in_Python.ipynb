        "\n",
        "- **Validate the URL:** This example focuses on using regex to check if a given URL is valid. It introduces the validate_url function, which employs a complex regex pattern to ensure URLs adhere to standard structures.\n",
        "- **Match the URL from the string:** This example demonstrates how to extract URLs from a given text string. It utilizes the extract_urls function and a regex pattern designed to identify URLs within text.\n",
        "- **Match the URL from the string and print URL:** This example expands on the previous one by not only extracting URLs but also extracting the domain names from those URLs. It uses the `extract_urls_and_domains` function and two regex patterns for URL and domain extraction.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Key Concepts:**\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Regular Expressions:** A sequence of characters that define a search pattern, used for pattern matching within text.\n",
        "- **URL Validation:** The process of checking if a URL is syntactically correct and conforms to expected standards.\n",
        "- **URL Extraction:** The process of identifying and extracting URLs from larger text content.\n",
        "- **Domain Extraction:** The process of isolating the domain name (e.g., google.com) from a URL."
