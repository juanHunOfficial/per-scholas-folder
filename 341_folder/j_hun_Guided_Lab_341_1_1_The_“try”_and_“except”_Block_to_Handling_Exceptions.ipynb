        "**Key Concepts Covered:**\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Basic Exception Handling:** The lab introduces the fundamental try and except blocks. Code within the try block is monitored for errors. If an error (exception) occurs, the code within the except block is executed, preventing the program from crashing.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Handling Specific Exceptions:** Instead of catching all exceptions generically, the lab demonstrates how to handle specific exception types (like ValueError and ZeroDivisionError) using multiple except blocks. This allows for tailored error messages and more robust code.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **User Input and Error Handling:** The provided examples illustrate how to handle potential errors arising from user input, such as when a user enters invalid data types or attempts to divide by zero.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "## **Learning Objective:**\n",
        "In this lab, you will demonstrate how to handle exceptions in Python.\n",
        "\n",
        "By the end of the lab, you will be able to:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Handle exceptions using the try, except, and finally statements.\n",
        "- Use built-in exception effectively to build robust Python programs.\n"
